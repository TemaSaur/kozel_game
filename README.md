# kozel_game

Kozel is a soccer-like competitive game in which you have to hit the wall with the ball in a certain number of kicks (tries) \[lets call it `n`\] (usually 2 or 1).
The game is played in an open environment between some number of people.
Every player starts with an empty "status".
Every time a player misses `n` times in one move, we add a letter to his "status" from the word `kozel` ('goat' in English).
When a player gets all the 5 letters and his "status" becomes `kozel` he loses.
